# Laubach-Williams R star

This repository contains files to replicate the [New York Fed's estimation procedures for the natural rate of interest (R-star)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar).

The Laubach-Williams and Holston-Laubach-Williams models provide estimates of the natural rate of interest, or r-star, and related variables. Their approach defines r-star as **the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable**.

The Laubach-Williams (2003) model uses data on real GDP, inflation, and the federal funds rate to extract trends in U.S. economic growth and other factors influencing the natural rate of interest. Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2023) adapts the model following the COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic.
