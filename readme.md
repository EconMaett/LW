# R star

This repository contains files to replicate the [New York Fed's estimation procedures for the natural rate of interest (R-star)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar).

The Laubach-Williams and Holston-Laubach-Williams models provide estimates of the natural rate of interest, or r-star, and related variables. Their approach defines r-star as **the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable**.

The Laubach-Williams (2003) model uses data on real GDP, inflation, and the federal funds rate to extract trends in U.S. economic growth and other factors influencing the natural rate of interest. Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2023) adapts the model following the COVID‑19 pandemic. 

The Holston-Laubach-Williams (2017) model extends this analysis to other advanced economies, estimating r-star and related variables for the United States, Canada, and the Euro Area. The Holston-Laubach-Williams (2023) model accounts for time-varying volatility and incorporates a persistent supply shock during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Estimates for all three economies are shown in the HLW Estimates tab linked above.
